<h1>Project 1: Visualizing Anscombeâ€™s Quartet</h1>

Author: Shruthi Sukumar

Collaborated with: Adam Winchell


<h2>Submission: </h2>

Parts 1-5 completed--- code added in index.html

<h3>Whistle completed: Replication</h3>

Replicated the results of part 1-5 in Tableau (WYSIWYG).

Each of the graphs was created as a separate sheet in Tableau. Each of the four Anscombe data files was imported using the software. All of the plots were assembled finally in a "dashboard" on tableau. The height and width of the individual tiles as well as the entire ensemble were finally adjusted to get a close match to the ensemble which is the output of index.html. The result of this can be viewed in the file tableau_replication.png.
