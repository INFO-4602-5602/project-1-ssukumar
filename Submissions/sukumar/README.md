<h1>Project 1: Visualizing Anscombeâ€™s Quartet</h1>

Author: Shruthi Sukumar

Collaborated with: Adam Winchell


<h2>Submission: </h2>

Parts 1-5 completed--- code added in index.html

<h3>Whistle completed: Replication</h3>

Replicated the results of part 1-5 in Tableau (WYSIWYG).

Each of the graphs was created as a separate sheet in Tableau. Each of the four Anscombe data files was imported using the software. All of the plots were assembled finally in a "dashboard" on tableau. The height and width of the individual tiles as well as the entire ensemble were finally adjusted to get a close match to the ensemble which is the output of index.html. This was different than programmatically coding in the dimensions of the svg in d3 to ensure they fall into the right place. The result of this can be viewed in the file tableau_replication.png. Individual images in the dashboard can be viewed inside the folder tableau_images/.
